    # This workflow creates a new Loco application and builds a Docker image
    # We only want this to run on the main repository (loco-rs/loco) and not on forks because:
    # 1. It consumes GitHub Actions minutes unnecessarily on forks
    # 2. The Docker build and deployment is specific to the main repository
    # 3. Forks typically don't need to run this automated deployment process
