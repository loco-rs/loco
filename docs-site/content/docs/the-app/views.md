In `Loco`, the processing of web requests is divided between a controller, model and view.

* **The controller** is handling requests parsing payload, and then control flows to models
* **The model** primarily deals with communicating with the database and executing CRUD operations when required. As well as modeling all business and domain logic and operations.
* **The view** takes on the responsibility of assembling and rendering the final response to be sent back to the client. 
 

You can choose to have _JSON views_, which are JSON responses, or _Template views_ which are powered by a template view engine and eventually are HTML responses. You can also combine both.

<div class="infobox">
This is similar in spirit to Rails' `jbuilder` views which are JSON, and regular views, which are HTML, only that in LOCO we focus on being JSON-first.
</div>

## JSON views
As an example we have an endpoint that handles user login.  When the user is valid we can pass the `user` model into the `LoginResponse` view (which is a JSON view) to return the response.

There are 3 steps:

1. Parse, accept the request
2. Create domain objects: models
3. Hand off the domain model to a view object which **shapes** the final response

The following Rust code represents a controller responsible for handling user login requests, which handes off _shaping_ of the response to `LoginResponse`.

```rust
use crate::{views::auth::LoginResponse};
async fn login(
    State(ctx): State<AppContext>,
    Json(params): Json<LoginParams>,
) -> Result<Response> {
    // Fetching the user model with the requested parameters
    // let user = users::Model::find_by_email(&ctx.db, &params.email).await?;

    // Formatting the JSON response using LoginResponse view
    format::json(LoginResponse::new(&user, &token))
}
```

On the other hand, `LoginResponse` is a response shaping view, which is powered by `serde`:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

use crate::models::_entities::users;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct LoginResponse {
    pub token: String,
    pub pid: String,
    pub name: String,
}

impl LoginResponse {
    #[must_use]
    pub fn new(user: &users::Model, token: &String) -> Self {
        Self {
            token: token.to_string(),
            pid: user.pid.to_string(),
            name: user.name.clone(),
        }
    }
}

```

## Template views

When you want to return HTML to the user, you use server-side templates. This is similar to how Ruby's `erb` works, or Node's `ejs`, or PHP for that matter.

For server-side templates rendering we provide the built in `TeraView` engine which is based on the popular [Tera](http://keats.github.io/tera/) template engine.

<div class="infobox">
To use this engine you need to verify that you have a <code>ViewEngineInitializer</code> in <code>initializers/view_engine.rs</code> which is also specified in your <code>app.rs</code>. If you used the SaaS Starter, this should already be configured for you.
</div>

The Tera view engine takes resources from the new `assets/` folder. Here is an example structure:

```
assets/
├── i18n
│   ├── de-DE
│   │   └── main.ftl
│   ├── en-US
│   │   └── main.ftl
│   └── shared.ftl
├── static
│   ├── 404.html
│   └── image.png
└── views
    └── home
        └── hello.html
config/
:
src/
├── controllers/
├── models/
:
└── views/
```


### Creating a new view

First, create a template. In this case we add a Tera template, in `assets/views/home/hello.html`. Note that **assets/** sits in the root of your project (next to `src/` and `config/`).

```html
<html><body>
find this tera template at <code>assets/views/home/hello.html</code>: 
<br/>
<br/>
{{ /* t(key="hello-world", lang="en-US") */ }}, 
<br/>
{{ /* t(key="hello-world", lang="de-DE") */ }}

</body></html>
```

Now create a strongly typed `view` to encapsulate this template in `src/views/dashboard.rs`:

```rust
// src/views/dashboard.rs
use loco_rs::prelude::*;

pub fn home(v: impl ViewRenderer) -> Result<impl IntoResponse> {
    format::render().view(&v, "home/hello.html", data!({}))
}

```

And add it to `src/views/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub mod dashboard;
```

Next, go to your controller and use the view:


```rust
// src/controllers/dashboard.rs
use loco_rs::prelude::*;

use crate::views;

pub async fn render_home(ViewEngine(v): ViewEngine<TeraView>) -> Result<impl IntoResponse> {
    views::dashboard::home(v)
}

pub fn routes() -> Routes {
    Routes::new().prefix("home").add("/", get(render_home))
}

```

Finally, register your new controller's routes in `src/app.rs`

```rust
pub struct App;
#[async_trait]
impl Hooks for App {
    // omitted for brevity

    fn routes(_ctx: &AppContext) -> AppRoutes {
        AppRoutes::with_default_routes()
            .add_route(controllers::notes::routes())
            .add_route(controllers::auth::routes())
            .add_route(controllers::user::routes())
            // include your controller's routes here
            .add_route(controllers::dashboard::routes())
    }
```

Once you've done all the above, you should be able to see your new routes when running `cargo loco routes`

```
$ cargo loco routes
[GET] /_health
[GET] /_ping
[POST] /api/auth/forgot
[POST] /api/auth/login
[POST] /api/auth/register
[POST] /api/auth/reset
[POST] /api/auth/verify
[GET] /api/notes
[POST] /api/notes
[GET] /api/notes/:id
[DELETE] /api/notes/:id
[POST] /api/notes/:id
[GET] /api/user/current
[GET] /home              <-- the corresponding URL for our new view
```

### How does it work?

* `ViewEngine` is an extractor that's available to you via `loco_rs::prelude::*`
* `TeraView` is the Tera view engine that we supply with Loco also available via `loco_rs::prelude::*`
* Controllers need to deal with getting a request, calling some model logic, and then supplying a view with **models and other data**, not caring about how the view does its thing
* `views::dashboard::home` is an opaque call, it hides the details of how a view works, or how the bytes find their way into a browser, which is a _Good Thing_
* Should you ever want to swap a view engine, the encapsulation here works like magic. You can change the extractor type: `ViewEngine<Foobar>` and everything works, because `v` is eventually just a `ViewRenderer` trait

### Static assets

If you want to serve static assets and reference those in your view templates, you can use the _Static Middleware_, configure it this way:


```yaml
static:
  enable: true
  must_exist: true
  precompressed: false
  folder:
    uri: "/static"
    path: "assets/static"
  fallback: "assets/static/404.html"
```

In your templates you can refer to static resources in this way:

```html
<img src="/static/image.png"/>
```


### Customizing the Tera view engine

The Tera view engine comes with the following configuration:

* Template loading and location: `assets/**/*.html`
* Internationalization (i18n) configured into the Tera view engine, you get the translation function: `t(..)` to use in your templates

If you want to change any configuration detail for the `i18n` library, you can go and edit `src/initializers/view_engine.rs`.

By editing the initializer you can:

* Add custom Tera functions
* Remove the `i18n` library
* Change configuration for Tera or the `i18n` library
* Provide a new or custom, Tera (maybe a different version) instance


### Using your own view engine

If you do not like Tera as a view engine, or want to use Handlebars, or others you can create your own custom view engine very easily.

Here's an example for a dummy "Hello" view engine. It's a view engine that always returns the word _hello_.

```rust
// src/initializers/hello_view_engine.rs
use axum::{async_trait, Extension, Router as AxumRouter};
use loco_rs::{
    app::{AppContext, Initializer},
    controller::views::{ViewEngine, ViewRenderer},
    Result,
};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct HelloView;
impl ViewRenderer for HelloView {
    fn render<S: Serialize>(&self, _key: &str, _data: S) -> Result<String> {
        Ok("hello".to_string())
    }
}

pub struct HelloViewEngineInitializer;
#[async_trait]
impl Initializer for HelloViewEngineInitializer {
    fn name(&self) -> String {
        "custom-view-engine".to_string()
    }

    async fn after_routes(&self, router: AxumRouter, _ctx: &AppContext) -> Result<AxumRouter> {
        Ok(router.layer(Extension(ViewEngine::from(HelloView))))
    }
}
```

To use it, you need to add it to your `src/app.rs` hooks:


```rust
// src/app.rs
// add your custom "hello" view engine in the `initializers(..)` hook
impl Hooks for App {
    // ...
    async fn initializers(_ctx: &AppContext) -> Result<Vec<Box<dyn Initializer>>> {
        Ok(vec![
            // ,.----- add it here
            Box::new(initializers::hello_view_engine::HelloViewEngineInitializer),
        ])
    }
    // ...
```
